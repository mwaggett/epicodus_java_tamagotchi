# Tamagotchi

##### _Class and POST practice for Epicodus, 18 August 2015_

#### By **Aimee Reiss & Molly Waggett**

## Description

This app allows a user to create a new Tamagotchi pet to interact with. As time passes (i.e. the user 'does nothing'), the pet's activity level, food level, and sleep level drop. To raise these, the user must play with, feed, or give their pet a nap, respectively. If any of the tamagotchi's stats drop to 0, it dies and the user may create a new pet.
